# A R package for making R packages

Install it by running: 

```

library("devtools")

install_github('YunlongNie/makingRpk')

```

A demo example is under the Demo folder

Note that this package works in a max os system.


## The `git_push()` Function 
It allows you to git your files and upload it to your github account using R. The main reason I implement this function is trying to avoid push large files to github using github desktop. It crashes every time.
